<h1>How to write a Game Boy emulator – Part 5: Rewriting gammaboy in Go</h1>
<div class="meta">Posted on 2017-12-23</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.75em; text-align: center;"><i>This post is part of a <a href="https://gammpei.github.io/blog/series/how-to-write-a-game-boy-emulator.html">blog series about writing a Game Boy emulator</a>.</i></p>


<p>I initially wrote gammaboy in Rust, but I decided to rewrite it in Go. Why Go and why not Rust?</p>

<p>Rust was blazing fast. I have no complaints about its speed. The Go rewrite is about twice slower (1s vs 0.5s). It's slower, but likely plenty fast for our purposes.</p>

<p>Rust is closer to the metal, which allows more room for optimization: you know if every variable is stack or heap allocated, you can inline functions, you have no garbage collector to worry about.</p>

<p>So why choose a slower, farther-from-the-metal language?</p>

<p>My major complaint with Rust is that it sucks the joy out of programming. I passed all my time trying to convince the borrow checker that what I was doing was correct, more than I was actually programming. Why use Rust if I secretly wanted to stick <code>unsafe</code>s everywhere?</p>

<p>Go is a language that has grown on me. It's simple, it has a nice standard library, it's somewhat close to the metal for a garbage collected language, and it's still performant. There are many things that I don't like about it, but it's a nice language overall. It has become my go-to programming language.</p>

<p>The Go rewrite is mostly the same as the Rust version. I cleaned up a couple things here and there, but that's it.</p>
