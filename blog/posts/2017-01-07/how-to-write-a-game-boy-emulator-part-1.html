<p><i>This is the first part of a blog series about writing a Game Boy emulator.</i></p>

<p>Writing an emulator may seem like an impossible task, but I can assure you that it's very fun and rewarding. The difficult part is not writing the emulator, it's understanding how the emulated machine works. As always, code is cheap, but documentation is priceless.</p>

<p>My goal is to demystify how emulators work. To this end, I will document and provide the code for each step, so that people can follow along.</p>
