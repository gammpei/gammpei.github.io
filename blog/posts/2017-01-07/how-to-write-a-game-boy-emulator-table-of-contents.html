<p><i>This is the first post of a blog series about writing a Game Boy emulator.</i></p>

<p>Writing an emulator may seem like an impossible task, but I can assure you that it's very fun and rewarding. The difficult part is not writing the emulator, it's understanding how the emulated machine works. As always, code is cheap, but documentation is priceless.</p>

<p>Each part of this tutorial will include all needed code, and will be associated to a single commit in the <a href="https://github.com/gammpei/gammaboy">gammaboy GitHub repository</a>.</p>
