<div class="date">Posted on 2017-01-07</div>

<p><i>This is the first post of a blog series about writing a Game Boy emulator.</i></p>

<p>Writing an emulator may seem like an impossible task, but I can assure you that it's very fun and rewarding. The difficult part is not writing the emulator, it's understanding how the emulated machine works. As always, code is cheap, but documentation is priceless.</p>

<p>Each part of this tutorial will come with all needed code, and will be associated to a single commit in the <a href="https://github.com/gammpei/gammaboy">gammaboy GitHub repository</a>. The emulator itself is going to be written in Rust. I chose this language because I wanted to learn it, and because it seemed fit for our purposes: it's low-level, but it still has nice abstractions inspired by functional languages.</p>

<p>This tutorial is only possible because people before me have documented how the Game Boy works, and made their documentation available for free on the internet. Here is a non-exhaustive list of references I've used to write this tutorial.</p>
